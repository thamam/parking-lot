USER: I want to add dark mode to my React application

ASSISTANT: I can help you implement dark mode for your React application. Before we start, I need to understand a few things about your project:

1. Are you using any CSS framework or library? (Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, styled-components, etc.)

2. Should the theme preference persist across sessions? If yes, should we use localStorage, cookies, or a backend API?

3. Do you want a toggle switch, or should it follow the system preference automatically?

4. Are there any specific components that should NOT change in dark mode?

5. Would you like smooth transitions when switching themes, or instant changes?

Let me know your preferences and I'll implement the solution accordingly.
