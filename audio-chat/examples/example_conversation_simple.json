(Express.js, Fastify, NestJS, or something else?)\n\n2. What database do you prefer? PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or another option?\n\n3. For authentication, should we implement JWT tokens, session-based auth, or OAuth?\n\n4. Do you want to include rate limiting and API versioning from the start, or add those later?\n\nPlease let me know your preferences so I can build exactly what you need."
