I've completed the implementation of the user authentication feature.

Here's what I built:
- Login endpoint with email/password validation
- Session management with secure cookies
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Tests for authentication flow

The implementation is ready for review. Let me know if you need any changes.
