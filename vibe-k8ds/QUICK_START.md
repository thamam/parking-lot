## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Is this ready to build?
**A**: Yes for planning, no for code. You have:
- ✅ Complete UX design
- ✅ Technical architecture
- ✅ Learning curriculum
- ✅ Development roadmap

You need:
- ❌ Decisions on key questions (see ACTION_ITEMS.md)
- ❌ Team hired
- ❌ Funding secured
- ❌ Detailed activity specs
- ❌ Wireframes/mockups

### Q: How much will this cost?
**A**: $715K - $1.09M over 10 months
- Phase 1 (MVP): $210K - $320K
- Phase 2 (Beta): $215K - $325K
- Phase 3 (Launch): $290K - $445K

See EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for detailed breakdown.

### Q: How long until launch?
**A**: 10-11 months from start of development
- 4 months to MVP (World 1)
- 3 months to Beta (Worlds 2-3)
- 3 months to Public Launch (World 4)

Add 4-6 weeks for validation phase before development starts.

### Q: What team do I need?
**A**: Core team (Phase 1):
- Product Manager / Designer (1)
- Frontend Engineers - React Native (2)
- Backend Engineer - Node.js (1)
- UI/UX Designer (1)
- QA Engineer (0.5)
- Voice/Audio Specialist (contract)

See PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for scaling team requirements.

### Q: Can I do this with less budget?
**A**: Possible but risky. You could:
- Start with iOS only (save ~20%)
- Outsource development (save ~30% but higher risk)
- Skip some features (reduce scope)
- Extend timeline (reduce burn rate)

**Not recommended**: Quality critical for children's app.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A**: Three major risks:
1. **Voice recognition** might not work well with 4-6 year-olds
2. **Engagement** - kids might not stay engaged
3. **Market** - parents might not pay

**Mitigation**: User testing BEFORE full development (Phase 0).

### Q: Is this a good investment?
**A**: Depends on your goals:
- ✅ **First-mover** in pre-literate coding
- ✅ **Large market** (20M+ children in US)
- ✅ **Growing category** (EdTech +25% annually)
- ⚠️ **Capital intensive** ($1M to launch)
- ⚠️ **Regulatory complexity** (COPPA)
- ⚠️ **Unproven market** (needs validation)

**Recommendation**: Spend $10-20K on validation before full commitment.

### Q: Can I build this myself / with small team?
**A**: Challenging. Requires expertise in:
- React Native development
- Backend/API development
- Voice integration (TTS/STT)
- Child UX design
- Early childhood education
- Animation/motion design
- COPPA compliance

**Solo**: 18-24+ months (not recommended)
**Small team (3-4)**: 12-15 months
**Full team (6-8)**: 10 months (recommended)

### Q: What if I want to pivot or adjust?
**A**: Flexible! Common pivots:
- **Age range**: Adjust to 3-5 or 5-7
- **Subject**: Math, literacy, science instead of coding
- **Platform**: Focus on schools vs consumers
- **Model**: Paid-only vs freemium

The foundational work (voice-first, pre-literate UX) transfers to many variations.
