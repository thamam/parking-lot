# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: November 16, 2025**

## Quick Summary

- Serchify may earn commissions when you purchase through our links
- **Affiliate links are OPTIONAL** and can be disabled
- **No extra cost to you** - prices stay the same
- All affiliate links are clearly marked
- You can always view the original URL
- Full transparency - we tell you exactly how it works

## What Are Affiliate Links?

An affiliate link is a special URL that includes a tracking code. When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, the seller knows you came from Serchify and may pay us a small commission.

**Example:**

- **Original URL**: `https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123456.html`
- **Affiliate URL**: `https://www.aliexpress.com/item/123456.html?aff_trace_key=serchify&...`

The extra parameters (`?aff_trace_key=...`) are the affiliate tracking codes.

## How Affiliate Links Work in Serchify

### 1. It's Optional

Affiliate links are **OFF by default**. You must explicitly enable them in Settings.

**To Enable:**
1. Click Settings (gear icon)
2. Check "Enable affiliate links"
3. Click Save Settings

**To Disable:**
1. Click Settings
2. Uncheck "Enable affiliate links"
3. Click Save Settings

### 2. Clearly Marked

When affiliate links are enabled, every affiliate link is marked with:

- 🔗 **Icon**: Visual indicator next to the link
- **Label**: "Affiliate Link" badge
- **Tooltip**: Hover to see "This link supports Serchify development"

### 3. Original URL Available

You can always see the original, non-affiliate URL:

- Hover over any result to see both URLs in the tooltip
- Right-click → Copy Link to get the original URL
- Or simply disable affiliate links to get clean URLs

### 4. Transparent in UI

The extension clearly shows:
- When affiliate links are enabled/disabled
- Which links have affiliate codes
- A banner explaining the affiliate program

## Which Platforms Use Affiliate Links?

When enabled, we may use affiliate links for:

| Platform | Affiliate Program | Commission Rate |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| AliExpress | AliExpress Affiliate | Varies by category (typically 3-8%) |
| Temu | Temu Affiliate | Varies |
| Wish | Wish Affiliate | Varies |
| eBay | eBay Partner Network | Varies |
| DHGate | DHGate Affiliate | Varies |
| Banggood | Banggood Affiliate | Varies |

**Note:** Commission rates are set by the platforms, not by us. We have no control over them.

## Does It Cost You Extra?

**No.** Absolutely not.

- The product price is the same whether you use an affiliate link or not
- Shipping costs are the same
- Taxes are the same
- The seller sets the price, not us

The commission is paid by the seller from their existing margin, not added to your purchase.

## How Much Do We Earn?

It varies significantly:

- **Commission Range**: Typically 2-8% of the purchase price
- **When We Earn**: Only when you actually complete a purchase
- **If You Just Browse**: We earn nothing (and that's fine!)

**Example:**

If you buy a $50 item and we have a 5% commission:
- You pay: $50
- Seller earns: $47.50
- Serchify earns: $2.50

## Why Use Affiliate Links?

### It Supports Development

Developing and maintaining Serchify takes time and resources:

- **Development**: New features, bug fixes, improvements
- **Hosting**: For any backend services we might add
- **APIs**: Some search APIs have costs
- **Testing**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Support**: Answering user questions

Affiliate commissions help us keep Serchify:
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Actively maintained
- ✅ Privacy-focused (we don't sell your data)
- ✅ Without intrusive ads

### Alternative Funding Models

We chose affiliate links because:

- **Better than ads**: No annoying banners or pop-ups
- **Better than data selling**: We never sell your data
- **Better than subscriptions**: Keep the extension free for everyone
- **Aligned incentives**: We only earn when we help you find good products

## Your Choice Matters

We respect your decision:

### If You Enable Affiliate Links

- ✅ You support Serchify's development
- ✅ Help keep the extension free for everyone
- ✅ No additional cost to you
- ✅ Same shopping experience

### If You Disable Affiliate Links

- ✅ You still get full functionality
- ✅ All features remain available
- ✅ No guilt - it's completely optional
- ✅ Original URLs without tracking

**Both choices are totally fine.** Use Serchify however works best for you.

## FTC Compliance

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires disclosure of affiliate relationships. Here it is:

> **Material Connection Disclosure**: Serchify participates in affiliate programs with various online marketplaces. This means we may earn commissions on purchases made through our links. We only recommend products and platforms that we believe provide value to our users. Our opinions are our own and are not influenced by affiliate commissions.

## GDPR Compliance (EU Users)

Affiliate links may involve tracking cookies set by the marketplace (not by us). When you click an affiliate link:

- The marketplace may set a cookie to track the referral
- This is governed by the marketplace's privacy policy
- We have no access to this cookie or your purchase data
- You can clear cookies anytime in browser settings

## What Data Is Shared?

When you click an affiliate link:

**Shared with Marketplace:**
- That you came from Serchify
- Timestamp of click

**NOT Shared:**
- Your personal information
- Your browsing history
- What you search for
- Any data from Serchify

**After Purchase:**

We **may** receive (from the affiliate program):
- That a purchase was made
- Commission amount
- Product category (sometimes)

We **never** receive:
- Your name or contact info
- What specific product you bought
- Your account information
- Payment details

## Changes to Affiliate Program

We may:
- Add or remove affiliate platforms
- Update commission rates (as set by platforms)

If we make significant changes:

## Transparency Statistics

You can see your own affiliate link usage:

1. Settings → Affiliate Statistics
2. View:
   - Total links clicked
   - Affiliate vs. non-affiliate clicks
   - Breakdown by platform

This helps you understand how the feature is working for you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will enabling affiliate links make results biased?

**A:** No. Results are ranked by:
1. Relevance/confidence score
2. Price (if you sort by price)
3. Ratings

Whether a platform has an affiliate program doesn't affect ranking.

### Q: Do you hide cheaper options to push affiliate links?

**A:** Absolutely not. We show all results we find, sorted by match quality and price. Our goal is to help you find the best deals, regardless of affiliate status.

### Q: What if I enable affiliate links then change my mind?

**A:** Just disable in Settings. Already-clicked links will still have tracking codes, but future clicks will be clean URLs.

### Q: Can I enable affiliate links for some platforms but not others?

**A:** Currently it's all-or-nothing, but we're considering per-platform controls in the future.

### Q: Do you make more money if I buy expensive items?

**A:** Commission is percentage-based, so technically yes. But our goal is helping you save money - we'd rather you find a cheaper option that saves you $50 than a pricier one that earns us an extra dollar.

### Q: What if I use an ad blocker or privacy tool?

**A:** Some privacy tools strip tracking parameters. That's okay! Your choice to use privacy tools is more important than our affiliate earnings.
